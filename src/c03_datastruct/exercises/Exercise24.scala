/**
  * As an example, implement hasSubsequence for checking whether a List contains another List as a subsequence.
  *
  * For instance, List(1,2,3,4) would have List(1,2), List(2,3), and List(4) as subsequences, among others.
  *
  * You may have some difficulty finding a concise purely functional implementation that is also efficient. Thatâ€™s okay.
  * Implement the function however comes most naturally.
  *
  * Note: Any two values x and y can be compared for equality in Scala using the expression x == y.
