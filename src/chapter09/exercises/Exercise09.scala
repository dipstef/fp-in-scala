/**
  * Hard: At this point, you are going to take over the process. You’ll be creating a Parser[JSON] from scratch using
  * the primitives we’ve defined. You don’t need to worry (yet) about the representation of Parser. As you go, you’ll
  * undoubtedly discover additional combinators and idioms, notice and factor out common patterns, and so on.
  *
  * Use the skills you’ve been developing throughout this book, and have fun! If you get stuck, you can always consult the answers.
  *
  * Here’s some minimal guidance:
  *
  * Any general-purpose combinators you discover can be added to the Parsers trait directly.
  *
  * You’ll probably want to introduce combinators that make it easier to parse the tokens of the JSON format
  * (like string literals and numbers). For this you could use the regex primitive we introduced earlier.
  * You could also add a few primitives like letter, digit, whitespace, and so on, for building up your token parsers.”
