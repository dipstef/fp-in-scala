/**
  * Thereâ€™s an interesting consequence of being able to turn any traversable functor into a reversed listâ€”we can write,
  * once and for all, a function to reverse any traversable functor! Write this function, and think about what it means
  * for List, Tree, and other traversable functors.
  *
  * def reverse[A](fa: F[A]): F[A]
  *
  * It should obey the following law, for all x and y of the appropriate types:
  *
  * toList(reverse(x)) ++ toList(reverse(y)) == reverse(toList(y) ++ toList(x))
