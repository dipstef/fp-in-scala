  // This implementation of map2 passes the initial RNG to the first argument
  // and the resulting RNG to the second argument. It's not necessarily wrong
  // to do this the other way around, since the results are random anyway.
  // We could even pass the initial RNG to both `f` and `g`, but that might
  // have unexpected results. E.g. if both arguments are `RNG.int` then we would
  // always get two of the same `Int` in the result. When implementing functions
  // like this, it's important to consider how we would test them for
  // correctness.
