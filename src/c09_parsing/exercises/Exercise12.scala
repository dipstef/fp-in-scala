/**
  * Hard: In the next section, we’ll work through a representation for Parser and implement the Parsers interface
  * using this representation. But before we do that, try to come up with some ideas on your own.
  *
  * This is a very open-ended design task, but the algebra we’ve designed places strong constraints on possible
  * representations.
  *
  * You should be able to come up with a simple, purely functional representation of Parser that can be used to
  * implement the Parsers interface.
