package c07_parallelism.exercises

/**
  * Can you think of any other useful functions to write? Experiment with writing a few parallel computations of your
  * own to see which ones can be expressed without additional primitives. Here are some ideas to try:
  *
  * Is there a more general version of the parallel summation function we wrote at the beginning of this chapter?
  * Try using it to find the maximum value of an IndexedSeq in parallel.
  * Write a function that takes a list of paragraphs (a List[String]) and returns the total number of words across all
  * paragraphs, in parallel. Generalize this function as much as possible.
  *
  * Implement map3, map4, and map5, in terms of map2.
